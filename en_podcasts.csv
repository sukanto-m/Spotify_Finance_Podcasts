178,55tr8tkIXNlvtrzVPKCXkz,The Butler Financial Podcast,"Welcome to the Butler Financial Podcast. This is a series of conversations in which we (Mark Butler and Mikyo Butler) discuss the human intuitions that can make it vexingly difficult to be good investors or handle our money optimally. As well, we explore the intense emotions that can work for us, as rich sources of intelligence, or against us, as catalysts of a reactive state in which we compound previous errors. We are consistently fascinated and humbled by this subject matter, since even experts and professionals are not exempt from these challenges! However, if we understand our biases, unconscious assumptions, and underlying emotions, we can work skillfully with ourselves and our advisors to craft sound strategies and implement them with steadiness and equanimity. We hope you find these discussions interesting, if not personally illuminating.  Please note: we are not forecasting the direction or performance of equities or any other asset class. None of the views in this podcast should be interpreted as a “market call”, nor should they be used as the sole basis for making portfolio allocation or investment decisions.",['en'],Mikyo Butler

181,4nWiuUuXQvQBEKkuGWmd0S,THE F WORD - FINANCE PODCAST,"Brothers Geo and PJ embark on a journey to change the perceptions of finance.  In Society, Finance is treated like a swear word!  We overcomplicate it. We make it boring. We avoid it.  In school, we learn all about Chronozones, Pythagoras, Trigonometry, and Shakespeare. All topics that although they might be interesting, more often than not they are irrelevant and never used. Yet we neglect topics that every person is sure to encounter in his or her lifetime. Topics like setting up a budget, paying tax, saving and basic financial terminology are swept under the rug. Parents don’t want to talk to their children about money, it’s for Grownups and they chase the kids out of the room. Couples steer away from this topic and even if they do decide to do so, it ends up in a fight. And as friends, we also prefer to stick to more “interesting' topics like the weekend game or the latest make-up range.  We also aim to reach people who might not have the access or ability to a wealth manager and want to empower them to take control of their finances.  Please feel free to engage with us and ask questions or recommend topics you would like us to cover.",['en'],The F Word: Finance

When you have more passive income than you do expenses, you have achieved financial freedom. On this podcast, we work tirelessly toward your financial freedom. We cover topics like the Infinite Banking Concept, multifamily real estate, private lending and a multitude of other cutting edge ideas.

381,39JTL3W3w95Hv4p78LhWj5,The Pearls and Perils,"Welcome to the Pearls and Perils, my name is Peta-Kay, I started this podcast to enable me to share tips on investing in your personal growth an area often neglected by a lot of people. As well as lifestyle, relationships, finance tips (my guilty pleasure) and to share life experiences hence the name ""The Pearls & Perils"". Everyone experiences difficult moments in life, few transform their perilous moments into pearls. Let's thrive together! Head over to my website www.pearlsandperils.com   A bit about me: I was born in Jamaica but moved to the UK when I was 7 years old. My life in the UK has not been an easy one, but all the challenges and setbacks I have faced have made me the person I am today.  I worked in the health industry for 10 years starting off as an Administrator and progressed into management roles. I've gained a lot of finance and business management skills which I have applied to my personal finances and this has transformed the way in which I manage my money and has allowed me to build a strong financial foundation for myself, of which I will be sharing tips on.  I use to have terrible money management skills, but in mid 2019 I decided to stop living in the 'pay day cycle'.  Despite earning a good salary I would still hemorrhage through my salary within a few days of getting paid! As I started to run my personal finances as I would a business, I started to see results and developed better money management skills and a new sense of discipline.  This inspired me to start my financial coaching service; I knew that finances and money management is an area that a lot of people struggle in and I wanted to combine my skills and passion for finances with a service that would help people to stop surviving and start thriving in their finances.  I'm also a lifestyle blogger, events planner let's just summarise with an Entrepreneur lol. I'm married to my amazing husband Theo, I got married in 2018 it's been an amazing journey filled with highs and lows but I wouldn't have it any other way. My faith in God is what inspires me and is the source of my inner strength without this I would not have been able to overcome the depression I battled with for many years.   I love writing I use to write my own stories when I was younger which are yet to be published lol. I love to learn new things, cooking (I share cooking tutorials on my Youtube channel), baking, I have a passion for helping people to pursue their potential which motivated me to start this Podcast. I love to try new things, experience food from different cultures, travelling to new places one of my goals is to visit 50 countries by the time I'm 50.  If there are any topics  that you would like me to cover on the show feel free to email me on thepearlsandperils@gmail.com for all other enquiries please email me on petakayg@gmail.com  ​",['en'],Peta-Kay King

The Community Broadcasting Association of Australia is launching a new radio series dedicated to supporting consumers during the current pandemic. The economic upheaval triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic is causing global shockwaves. In just five months, Australia has witnessed widespread panic among consumers, millions of jobs lost, plummeting stock prices, and drastic declines in household consumption. In amongst the chaos, many are finding it challenging just to understand the fast-changing legislation and Government support, let alone reap the benefits. In an effort to support the financial wellbeing of Australians the Community Broadcasting Association of Australia has partnered with the Ecstra Foundation to equip Australian consumers with the support, advice, and access to resources they need to make financial decisions during the pandemic.  Each episode of the ten-part series will focus on a different area of financial interest. Episode 1 centres around unemployment, exploring themes like ‘You’ve lost your job – what happens now?’ and how to navigate the various government agencies to access financial assistance. Hosted by Walkley award-winning writer, editor and broadcaster, Jeff Sparrow, listeners will hear insights from financial experts, personal stories from those hardest hit, and representatives from specialist agencies and volunteer-run services like the Australian Unemployed Workers Union. The Consumer Coach is brought to you by the Community Broadcasting Association of Australia, supported by the Ecstra Foundation and heard across Australia on the Community Radio Network.

766,1tAdOS498BAwUbJC1wnSjy,Money Talks with Stephen Diedericks,"We welcome Stephen Diedericks to Hawke's Bay and Radio Kidnappers.    Stephen, his wife, Tania and their six children recently moved to Hastings from Australia, via Auckland. For Tania, this is a return to home, reconnecting with her school, Taikura Rudolf Steiner School.    Stephen started life thinking that he wants to be comfortable. He realised that, to be comfortable, he and everyone around him will have to be rich. This has led to Stephen's philosophy: ""if people do what they love, they will become rich and be comfortable - in reality, more than comfortable"".    After reviewing various paths to achieve this philosophy, Stephen found personal development and financial education. He is now a Professional Network Marketer, with a global On-line shop focusing on 'Swap Where You Shop' and for the past 20 months has been writing weekly financial education articles.    Stephen graduated from Wollongong University with a Bachelor of Commerce Degree, majoring in Accounting and Legal Studies. Since graduating and while working, he completed his Certified Practising Accountant (CPA) studies and a Juris Doctor (Masters of Law) at Monash Law School. Stephen's work experience was gained in the tax divisions of the global accounting firms, KPMG, PricewaterhouseCoopers and Ernst and Young. Stephen also gained experience working with the tax divisions of the New South Wales Treasury (Office of State Revenue) and the State Revenue Office (Victoria). In New Zealand, he has worked for law and accounting firms before establishing his own firm: Stephen's Tax, Business and Assets Protection Services Limited.    In his Accounting practice, Stephen negotiates tax write-offs and penalty and interest remissions. While working in Auckland, he successfully negotiated a tax write off of $253,000, which made his client cry.    Stephen's experience also includes asset structuring, asset protection and trust establishment and maintenance. This is where his law qualifications are valuable. He has been admitted as a Barrister and Solicitor of the High Court of New Zealand but operates as a Certified Practising Accountant.    Stephen's passion is financial literacy. He will not be sharing which shares you should buy or sell, or which mix of assets to have for diversification. He says you should see your financial adviser.    Stephen will focus on financial education by sharing his research and thoughts on different ways to generate additional income. In addition, he will also share his version of what his friend has termed the 'Inner Game of Money' and Stephen's own 'Outter Game of Money'.    Stephen also offers everyone a free 30-minute consultation to determine which business-type would be best suited to them. His contact details will be provided at the end of each programme. You can also find his broadcasts on YouTube and podcasted on Access Internet Radio.

You know they’re coming and that business advisory services are the way to go. But do you know how to rebuild your business to take advantage of these new opportunities?   My podcast will help you. I’ll be talking with small businesses of all kinds, sharing their financial stories and finding out what worked for them and what didn’t. All you have to do is listen and learn.   Call it a Business Mastermind in ‘What Your Clients Want From You’.   And if you’re a non-professional services business..…no problems....you’ll learn a lot from these conversations too.

Find out more at https://blueprinthq.com.au/  About Sam Dean:  I’ve been an accountant for decades, with senior roles and a partnership in a large firm. I’ve also run my own (non-accounting) small business. That was a real eye-opener. I discovered just how little my profession understood the issues facing our small business clients, how little we listened and how much we could offer – if we only knew what to provide and how to do it.   That was when I realised it was time for an industry-wide mindset shift.  I’ve met so many people that provide professional services, with great skills and experience. But too many of us have lost confidence and our faith in our profession.   I get that because I’ve been there. I gained a lot of weight, drank far too much and lost sight of my dreams, my self-belief, my skills and my expertise. I looked for leadership, but I couldn’t find it.  Then one day, I woke up to hear a clear, strong voice in my head; It was time to make changes – BIG changes.  I embarked on a voyage of personal, business and financial discovery. I discovered and created systems to help people like us. Now I work with accounting and professional services businesses, helping them to create and grow financial advisory services that build great businesses for their clients and themselves.",['en-US'],Sam Dean

What makes these numbers even more tragic is that 70 percent of all the HAIs are PREVENTABLE!Infection Prevent Spotlight was created by an Infection Preventionist (IP) certified in Infection Control (CIC) for other IPs and everyone else responsible for keeping patients safe from harm. It's hard for IPs to be responsible for reducing HAIs (CLABSIs, CAUTIs, SSIs, MDROs (C.diff, MRSA, VRE, CRE)) and the harm and deaths they cause as well as the financial costs of these results on Medicare reimbursement and public reporting. As an IP I understand this and that's why I've created this podcast. I wanted to make a safe place to talk about these challenges, understand the emerging issues, share the newest best practices and current research, and to be a place where IPs could support each other in our journey to zero Harm. Infection Prevention and Control spans multiple areas: hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, outpatient surgery centers, dialysis centers, ambulance companies / emergency management, schools, and even our homes. My hope is that Infection Prevention Spotlight will provide you with the motivation, knowledge, and quick tips to take back to your team, facility, for your own journey where ever it may be and prevent HAIs by engaging, communicating, leading, demonstrating, reviewing, and teaching about: hand hygiene (HH) |hand washing;  indwelling catheters;  central venous catheters; surgical procedures; isolation procedures / isolation precautions (Contact, Droplet, Airborne); Standard precautions; hospital leadership, IP systems and staff training; personal protective equipment; environmental services; linen / laundry; Reprocessing of non-critical equipment, semi-critical equipment (high-level disinfection), reusable critical equipment/instruments/devices (sterilization); ventilator / respiratory therapy; environmental disinfection / cleaning; antibiotic stewardship; performance improvement; and Survey Readiness.

871,1cv3y2dFMTNPEgsD2NCwkN,"Into the Unknown: Stories of Reclamation, Rebirth, and Alchemy","Into the Unknown: Stories of Reclamation, Rebirth, and Alchemy takes a light-hearted and often times humorous approach to deeply challenging spiritual, emotional, physical, cultural and societal matters. This is a podcast for ordinary people taking on the extraordinary task of questioning the status quo and transforming their lives accordingly. Increasingly more people are 'waking up' to the fact that what we've been taught through our systems, be it education, religious, healthcare, et al is dogma that has vastly informed our consciousness and might not reflect our true personal values. In a society where we are constantly bombarded with purposely curated information resulting in 'group think,' it takes a tremendous amount of strength and courage to take a step (or many) back and re-assess everything we've been taught. It takes even further critical approach to question what else exists that we haven't been taught and why we haven't been taught it. Humans are capable of so much more than most of us realize and many of us walk through the world unconscious to our power. So how do we hone our own intuition enough to realize our personal truth? From self-healing and alternative healing techniques to implementing approaches of quantum physics, to having mystical experiences, we will explore ways to activate our consciousness to have agency over our own lives and discover what truth resonates for us on a deep soul level. We will also be having discussions with professionals who were once part of the system, such as doctors, educators, scientists, government officials who had their own respective epiphanies and have either become mavericks in their chosen field or outspoken advocates against the system they once bought into.  We exist in a matrix of full of frequency, universal laws and possibility, it's time we explore it and take deep dive into the unknown.Legal and Medical DisclaimerThis podcast and related sites provide wellness management in aninformational, educational, and entertainment manneronly, with information that is general in nature and that is not specific to you, the listener/reader. The words and other con­tent pro­vided on the podcast/website and in any linked mate­ri­als, are not intended and should not be con­strued as med­ical advice.

At some point in our lives, we’ve all felt like we’re stuck in some area – whether in business or relationships. Many have gone through therapy, and yet haven’t been able to move forward. What’s going on? What’s blocking you, and how do you get unblocked? Let hypnotist, author, speaker, and success coach Mark Yuzuik guide you into gaining control of your life so you can shatter through those roadblocks, change your story, and create the life you want. Mark is a master hypnotist and has studied human behavior over the last twelve years – diving into what’s holding people back and why they do what they do. Join Mark on Get Your Mind Set for simple strategies on how you can unblock your subconscious mind so you can live a life that you want, take steps to grow, and contribute back and help others as well as yourself. Each week, he’ll be featuring guests who have been through various obstacles and struggles, people who have taken control and transformed their lives. They know what it’s like and they want to give back and help you.Having gone through years of therapy to understand and get over the personal issues brought on by an abusive school environment when he was twelve years old, Mark was introduced to hypnosis and Terry Stokes – one of the most acclaimed and accomplished hypnotist of our time – when his brother brought him to a fair. That was when he got hooked and tried to learn all about it, eventually diving into human behavior and how our mind works. As we all know, our mind has two parts – the conscious and the subconscious. The conscious mind analyzes everything. It is where our desire to acquire certain goals and to grow lies. The subconscious mind is the engine. We’re running these programs in our subconscious mind that makes us react to things automatically. And just like a car, we have to fix the engine and keep it tuned up.As Mark started learning about behaviors, he realized that people do what they do because they’re getting certain needs met. The problem is that it’s not always healthy. We do a lot of things in life to get our needs met even though it’s not going to help us grow because our brain is always in survival mode, but we don’t understand that and we’re constantly reacting automatically. We have to break through that subconscious mind so we can live a quality life, constantly grow, and be able to contribute back. And one way to break through is by changing our story. Things happen to us and we cannot change the events, but we can decide to take control and change our story. If we change the story to serve and help others, we’ll get out of our pain.In Get Your Mind Set, Mark and his guests will be tackling different topics about what’s going on in the world, the media, and in their personal lives. They will also be addressing questions from people from all walks of life, helping them identify why they’re stuck or why they procrastinate, and explaining and sharing stories on some of the things they have personally experienced to help them grow out of the problem and move forward.Get educated, inspired, motivated, and entertained. Achieve your desired goals and create a life of emotional, spiritual and financial abundance. Join Mark Yuzuik for some great conversations and insightful takeaways every week.

How do we build healthier and more engaging intimate relationships? How can something that happened when we were 4 years old still affect us when we are 57 years old? How can we heal our bodies with the foods we eat or eliminate? How can we tap into spontaneous healing with the placebo effect? What effect does our financial health have on our mental and physical health. We will take a deep dive into these and many more questions.

990,5HHLPX6oj0wQYH0AwOKmkv,Rhodes To Wealth,"Where does your path to financial freedom begin? Wealth building can be a misleading concept. A lot of information out there promotes get-rich-quick schemes or drives people to get into transactions they might otherwise never even take a second look at. Although having money and the ability to acquire things and pay the bills is great, we want you to build your wealth; that is, have the resources to create and take advantage of opportunities in life. Start your wealth-building journey with us here on the Rhodes To Wealth Podcast. Hosted by Joshua Rhodes, we bring you practical investing tips, entrepreneurship how-tos, and basic steps to building wealth that is simple to understand, helping you get you closer to financial freedom. Joshua Rhodes is the founder of Rhodes To Wealth, and the Rhodes To Wealth podcast, a platform set out to provide wealth-building advice, tips, and strategies from the world’s most successful wealth-building experts. As a first-generation graduate from Benedictine College, the idea and thought on how to ‘build wealth’ was not something that Joshua was shown much guidance in while growing up in Houston, Texas. Once out of college, Joshua found himself in an outside sales role in a leading cybersecurity company making more money than he knew what to do with. After a couple of years of simply saving his money, he went hunting for advice on what to do next. Instead of going the more traditional route of giving all his money to a financial advisor, he decided to take matters into his own hands and began searching for answers in books, articles, and experts. As Joshua dove into his ‘self-wealth’ building journey, he found himself a little lost due to the endless amount of ways a person can make money and grow their wealth. Each book he read and each class he came across had a different trick or scheme on how to make money, which always seemed to end with him handing over a couple of dollars of his own to their cause. Instead of investing in someone else's personal account, Joshua decided the best way for him to fully grasp wealth building was to invest in himself, and that is how Rhodes To Wealth was born. His goal in the Rhodes To Wealth platform and talking to wealth building experts is to help non-traditional wealth-building Millennials like himself who feel they have enough money to invest, but not enough knowledge to do it confidently, find a path that leads them to financial freedom - and hopefully early retirement. Wealth-building doesn’t happen overnight. Here on the Rhodes to Wealth Podcast, we’ll show you the steps to building wealth and teach you how you can discipline yourself to achieve your long-term goals. Featuring guests like Dorie Clark, a Top 50 Business Thinker in the world and the author of Entrepreneurial You: Monetize Your Expertise, Create Multiple Income Streams, and Thrive; Amos Schwartzfarb, the Managing Director of Techstars Austin and the author of Sell More Faster: The Ultimate Sales Playbook for Start-Ups; and Judy Robinett, a Startup Funding Expert and the author of Crack the Funding Code: How Investors Think and What They Need to Hear to Fund Your Startup, Joshua Rhodes and his esteemed guests will guide you on your wealth-building journey. Keep your eyes and ears to the ground in the market with wealth-building and financial strategies you never thought were possible. Start planning your finances and building your portfolio – and wealth! – with us here on Rhodes To Wealth!",['en'],Joshua Rhodes

The Right Method is the first of its kind, taking you into the homes of the top 1% with the key focus areas of health, finance, entrepreneurialism, mindset, and service to others. We are here to help you live your best life, transform your lifestyle, and obtain everything in life you truly desire.  Told by three-time Emmy-award winning journalist Dhomonique Murphy, The Right Method is compelling, engaging, fresh, educational, emotional, and entertaining.  Dhomonique Murphy is the President of The Right Method, LLC. The Emmy Award-winning television host and journalist and her husband, Frank Murphy, created the motivational self-help company as a way to help people rediscover their love for life.  During her nearly 20 years as a television host, anchor, and journalist, Dhomonique quickly discovered that everyone wants the same five things: love, purpose, health, financial independence, and respect. It may look different for each person, but those core principals of fulfillment are what everyone truly desires to obtain. The reality is, however, that most people are going through life, confused and frustrated, looking for a specific method or formula to achieve ultimate happiness and success. Years of long meditation and careful study brought Dhomonique to the conclusion that the idea of a one-size-fits-all approach to obtaining fulfillment is flawed.  Hence, the creation of The Right Method.   The Right Method is an experience. It is a conversation with the world’s greatest thought leaders about what life is truly about – true stories of overcoming crisis and achieving maximum triumph, how they built their empires, and inspired the world. The Right Method gives you the tools to reach optimum success in every phase of your life. It’s inspiring, uplifting, and unique!  We are all programmed to think that we can’t do things in life, but we are going to help you change your mindset and achieve your wildest dreams. You deserve to live an epic life, and we are here to help you achieve it. It’s time to start living a life that counts. We want you to be alive; we are going to awaken your senses and help you reach your maximum potential.   Every week, Dhomonique brings you special guests who share their stories of success and nuggets of advice – what they’ve done, who they are, and how you can implement what they’ve done to rise to the top!  We’re all looking for the same five things – love, purpose, health, financial independence, and respect – and they may come in different packages. Discover the right method for you only here on The Right Method with Dhomonique Murphy.",['en'],Dhomonique Murphy

What makes these numbers even more tragic is that 70 percent of all the HAIs are PREVENTABLE!Infection Prevent Spotlight was created by an Infection Preventionist (IP) certified in Infection Control (CIC) for other IPs and everyone else responsible for keeping patients safe from harm. It's hard for IPs to be responsible for reducing HAIs (CLABSIs, CAUTIs, SSIs, MDROs (C.diff, MRSA, VRE, CRE)) and the harm and deaths they cause as well as the financial costs of these results on Medicare reimbursement and public reporting. As an IP I understand this and that's why I've created this podcast. I wanted to make a safe place to talk about these challenges, understand the emerging issues, share the newest best practices and current research, and to be a place where IPs could support each other in our journey to zero Harm. Infection Prevention and Control spans multiple areas: hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, outpatient surgery centers, dialysis centers, ambulance companies / emergency management, schools, and even our homes. My hope is that Infection Prevention Spotlight will provide you with the motivation, knowledge, and quick tips to take back to your team, facility, for your own journey where ever it may be and prevent HAIs by engaging, communicating, leading, demonstrating, reviewing, and teaching about: hand hygiene (HH) |hand washing;  indwelling catheters;  central venous catheters; surgical procedures; isolation procedures / isolation precautions (Contact, Droplet, Airborne); Standard precautions; hospital leadership, IP systems and staff training; personal protective equipment; environmental services; linen / laundry; Reprocessing of non-critical equipment, semi-critical equipment (high-level disinfection), reusable critical equipment/instruments/devices (sterilization); ventilator / respiratory therapy; environmental disinfection / cleaning; antibiotic stewardship; performance improvement; and Survey Readiness.

1245,3XPVCV6lLsPKfA1PzYannd,The Long Term Real Estate Investor Podcast hosted by Eduardo Sigal,"Hello, I'm Eduardo Sigal. Welcome to The Long term Real Estate Investor podcast, where you get the opportunity to learn from the experiences of family owned real estate companies and other professionals geared towards helping you make the right decisions for your investment goals.So you might ask yourself, why should I listen to this show? As in everything in life, decisions are what make our path to success or to failure. Unfortunately, there's a ton of information available that is in complete contradiction to what many successful investors actually do. This includes how to operate your investments when thinking about your personal financial needs and your family's future. On top of that, in today's world of instant returns, many crowdfunding platforms favor high return short length deals. This is usually at the cost of much bigger risk. The real estate crowdfunding market is growing fast. It's on its road to being a $300 billion industry and is bringing in more investors than ever before. This is due to big changes in regulatory restrictions. Here's the problem. There's not a ton of easily accessible quality and appropriate information available. I use the word appropriate because what works for institutions often times won't work for the individuals investment needs. This is because the goals and strategies are different. Let me give you some background. When I was young, I was fascinated with real estate. My father would bring me along with his partners for meetings. Some of them were big shots. I would listen to how they analyzed new opportunities and how they managed opportunities through different obstacles.As I got older and developed my skill sets in real estate, I would always unconsciously resort to those conversations for perspective. That's when I noticed the rarity of the wisdom I acquired from my unique circles. I couldn't find that kind of wisdom in any educational program I've been through, including my MBA program. Having the wisdom from landlords and industry leaders who have weathered these cycles is invaluable, as well as using that proven success and advice to design your long term real estate investment strategy. That is the solution. This podcast is personally exciting. Besides having a ton of respect for everyone, I bring on the podcast. I've been looking forward to these discussions because they shed light on how successful family owned real estate investment businesses approach investments and how you can too. I'll give you a clue. It's not always about the numbers, but it is about weathering the storm when things as they always do get rough. There's a unique wisdom to each conversation, and if you believe in learning from the success of others, then you will like this podcast and his community of like minded investors. You can add that to your portfolio. Want more solutions or to get in touch with us? Go to our website at WWW.LONGTERMREI.COM for articles, other podcasts, and more information.

Our guests are millennials and professional athletes, because what better way to learn than from peers in a similar situation.   Communication is the most important part of financial literacy. When we know better, we have the opportunity to do better. It’s not about the numbers, but the strategies. We focus way to much on dollar amounts instead of the knowledge needed to experience financial growth. No matter your financial situation transparency and knowledge are key to continued improvement. Worth Listening was created to provide just that. After all, the more examples you hear the less you’ll feel alone as you navigate the world of personal finance. Host Lauryn Williams, financial planner and Olympian leads in-depth conversations with guests, having them share what she calls their ""money memoir"" to offer insight into how money works in their sport or profession. On the Worth Listening podcast, dollars aren’t the most important thing. It’s the process, the techniques, and the stories that deliver real value to listeners. A person’s knowledge is what gives you power, not knowing how much money they make.   Everyone has a unique story and experiences both wins and losses. You don’t have to get it all right to be alright. The mistakes are not what’s crippling us, it’s the inability to be open and deal honestly with the cause of the mistake. When a financial mistake or setback happens, what’s important is that you learn, get organized, and move on. Lauryn gives listeners something they can relate to, something that builds courage to be open and take control of their own money story.",['en'],Lauryn Williams

1301,3LYmtJbwqRSg12hR5uKpQi,Love Is Just Damn Good Business,"It’s time to toss aside the touchy-feely notions of love in business and recognize the real power it holds. Love is not only appropriate in the context of business, it’s the foundation of great leadership, and, therefore, the very foundation of a thriving, competitive enterprise. Welcome to the Love Is Just Damn Good Business podcast where host Steve Farber talks with business leaders who are operationalizing love as a strategic advantage.Farber’s guests share their proven strategies, inspiring case studies, and practical lessons on how to build corporate and team cultures based on love—the ultimate competitive advantage. You’ll discover why (and how) Love, at the end of the day, is just damn good business for you, too. Many businesspeople are frustrated by a gap between what they desire from their leadership and business efforts and what they’re able to accomplish; however, more and more successful leaders, executives, and entrepreneurs are successfully bridging that gap with phenomenal success. What is their secret? What code have they cracked?They go beyond the traditional definition of leadership to make a significant, positive difference on their own company or within the company that they work for. These are people who take their own personal development seriously and don’t see it as something contrary to their professional development. And at their core, they recognize that love is a powerful leadership and business principle—and they operationalize it in the way they work with colleagues, employees, and customers alike. The good news is that you can achieve that same level of success, too. Here on the Love Is Just Damn Good Business podcast, Steve Farber, Founder of The Extreme Leadership Institute, will be teaching you how to operationalize love as a business and leadership practice.Your competitive advantage comes from your customers and clients loving what you do for them. Customer “satisfaction” just isn’t enough anymore. So, how do you take your business to the highest level where your customers are your greatest advocates, your employees are your greatest performers and recruiters, and your personal fulfillment is at its peak?Farber has found that the only way to accomplish all of that in a meaningful and sustainable way over time is to operationalize love as a discipline and a practice rather than a soft, fluffy sentiment. So what does it look like to conduct your business that way? How do you show your customers that you really love them? And how do you create a culture that your employees, teammates, colleagues love working in? Business leaders have been asking these questions for years. In this show, Steve addresses those questions head on. Having had a broad exposure to a vast array of companies spanning three decades, Steve Farber has discovered that the practice of “doing what you love in the service of people who love what you do” is a powerful, universal leadership credo that runs through all county, industry, and company cultures.A subject-matter expert in business leadership and one of Inc’s global Top 50 Leadership and Management Experts, Steve is a leadership speaker and a senior-level leadership coach and consultant who has worked with and spoken to a wide variety of public and private organizations in virtually every arena – from the tech sector to financial services, manufacturing, health care, hospitality, entertainment, retail, and government. He is the bestselling author of Greater Than Yourself, The Radical Edge, and The Radical Leap, which was named one of the 100 Best Business Books of All Time. His much-anticipated new book, Love Is Just Damn Good Business, is in stores now. Steve’s passion is coaching and inspiring Extreme Leadership at all organizational levels by teaching leaders how to operationalize love as a discipline and a practice. Join him and his guests here on the podcast and learn specific ideas on how to operationalize love and be reenergized to make a significant difference in your businesses, personal life, and the world around you.

1332,2f2jeVhvpRDUiAtH0DaZYY,Hyperwave,"Co-hosted by D. Tyler Jenks and Leah WaldD. Tyler Jenks, the President, and CIO of Lucid Investment Strategies LLC developed the proprietary technical system of Hyperwave. After 40 years as an investment manager, he discovered over 300 examples of Hyperwaves within various asset classes; stocks, bonds, commodities, indexes, and cryptocurrencies. Through careful study, he invented and developed the Hyperwave Theory, which is a technical tool to analyze the Hyperwaves and determine price movements. Tyler believes that Bitcoin is currently in a Hyperwave and through these vlogs, he will educate, elucidate and explain the techniques needed to understand this powerful tool. Tyler has managed billions of dollars for Institutional Investors, Pension Funds, Hedge Funds and individual clients. He received his MBA from the University of Hawaii in 1975 and has been involved in the financial markets ever since. His background in technical analysis includes all the major techniques including a number of proprietary systems he and others created and designed. Tyler believes that Hyperwaves occur when there is a momentous shift taking place in the macroeconomic environment. Hyperwaves were formed as the world entered the Great Depression when Bretton Woods was scuttled with the US going off the gold standard in 1971, when Japan rose to world economic prominence in the 1970s and 80s, when the Nasdaq was powered by the dot-com bubble and now, with the introduction of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. Amazingly, Tyler believes this newest Hyperwave could be the most significant he has ever studied.Lucid Investment Strategies, LLC https://lucidfunds.com Tyler's Twitter: https://twitter.com/LucidInvestment Leah's Twitter: https://twitter.com/LeahWald Leah's LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/leahwald/ Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions!Bitcoin: 31qBca9jRFfux1Qsum9Ekp95MBSgCEWxt6Disclaimer: This video is based on personal opinion and experience and it should not be considered professional financial investment advice.

1343,4nlPBW1b2dbqUishiqkDvj,Arrest Your Debt,"Ryan Luke, a police lieutenant in Arizona, started Arrest Your Debt, an online blog, to provide targeted financial information to first responders. Ryan is filling the personal finance void that first responders need to reduce stress and improve their mental health.  Arrest Your Debt, Filling The Personal Finance Void For First Responders   13th April, 2020, Arizona: First responders are known for having to deal with stress on a daily basis. This reoccurring stress can lead to substance abuse and other unhealthy coping mechanisms. Also, first responders are skeptical by nature and have difficulty trusting personal finance advice from traditional investment companies. Due to this, Lieutenant Ryan Luke has made it his mission to fill this financial education void and started the website Arrest Your Debt.   As a fellow first responder, Ryan understands the daily stress of the job and recognizes the unhealthy spending habits many of his fellow officers have. A large number of officers and firefighters attempt to reduce stress by spending money and buy “stuff” to fill emotional voids. However, this increased spending and lack of retirement planning lead to even more stress, to include marital problems.   Ryan’s mission is to educate first responders on proper money management and to show them first-hand how they can become debt-free and build wealth on a public servant’s salary. Ryan is the sole income earner in a family of 5 and has been able to pay off his mortgage and build wealth with only one income. He speaks to public safety employees on their level to help first responders get out of debt and take control of their finances.   Arrest Your Debt focuses on educating first responders that they don't need to be compulsorily poor; they only require proper insight about how to utilize their existing assets tactfully. To do so, they need to follow a few simple tips like establishing a budget, creating an emergency fund, focus on paying off debt, and using side hustles and off duty jobs to accelerate the wealth building process.   The founder of the company, Lieutenant Ryan Luke, said, ""I have always been interested in personal finance, and I want to be the financial resource first responders can trust. By showing them it’s possible to live debt-free, I feel a first responder’s emotional and mental health can be greatly improved.” He also emphasizes the importance of learning the basics about finances and wealth management and how financial literacy improves the overall quality of living.   One of the most significant strategies of wealth management he mentions on the blog, is the systematic usage of sinking funds. These funds are goal-oriented, so future purchases are made with cash instead of credit. Simple strategies like this are easy to understand but incredibly efficient at helping first responders take control of their money.   This website also focuses on the causes of never-ending debt and how to overcome it without draining personal assets. The company is a one-stop solution for people who are living paycheck to paycheck and do not have a clear vision of how to invest.   About the company:   Arrest Your Debt was founded in 2018, by Lieutenant Ryan Luke, a police officer in Arizona. The company aims at giving easy to understand personal finance tips and strategies to first responders so they can arrest their debt and build their wealth. The company provides the financial building blocks necessary to manage personal resources and use them for a better living, even on a public servant salary. Arrest Your Debt has been featured in Forbes, MarketWatch, MSN, Experian, Thrive Global, and The Simple Dollar.   ",['en'],Ryan Luke

1385,1WY8YcALwKk7VlsvjmfYBh,Get Fundable,"Are you f*able, or just plain f’d? Have you ever walked into a bank and the second you mention what your business is, you are denied because of either the risk associated with your business or some other thing that you’re not even aware of? If you are that business owner, entrepreneur, or real estate investor who’s been denied too many times, then it’s time to roll up your sleeves and listen to this podcast so you can start working on making yourself fundable.  Hosted by personal and business fundability expert Merrill Chandler, GET FUNDABLE! Podcast gives the answers and solutions to why Lenders may not be jumping up and down to give you money. When you become more fundable, you automatically put yourself in a position to get the money you need to do your deals. Join us right here on GET FUNDABLE! Podcast.  Not having the money to scale your business or to do deals when they come across your table can literally be soul-crushing but 100% avoidable if you are fundable! With the current automatic underwriting and risk analytics systems, 80% of funding approvals for YOUR BUSINESS are based on YOUR PERSONAL CREDIT PROFILE.  At GetFundable.com we have the solution to help the unfundable become fundable! Get answers to funding questions that you didn’t even know you should ask. Get a look behind the curtain at the inner workings of the funding approval system. Have the bankers and the credit system playbooks so you can easily navigate the funding process.  Merrill Chandler is a High-Performance Fundability Coach at GetFundable.com (powered by CreditSense). Over 25 years ago, Merrill Chandler—co-founder of Lexington Law Firm—became dissatisfied with the ineffective results of credit repair alone. Leveraging his extensive knowledge of borrower behavior profiles, FICO® scoring metrics, and lender underwriting requirements, he developed a process that could ‘optimize’ a consumer’s borrower behavior AND improve a borrower’s “fundability.” He founded GetFundable.com to deliver this revolutionary technology to real estate investors, business owners, and entrepreneurs nationwide. Merrill has helped thousands of borrowers become more FUNDABLE and help them access the capital they need to fulfill their financial dreams. The cool thing is that when you are fundable, it helps you to be able to pass through Lender automatic underwriting processes without the risk of getting a manual review from an individual that can deny you or look for reasons to deny you, when an automatic underwriting system would actually be able to qualify you.  With client fundings of over $103,000,000 over the last few years, Merrill’s team has been able to help every type of entrepreneur, business owner, or real estate investor get in a position to be fundable and ultimately be able to accomplish what they need for the growth of their companies.  How much does being unfundable cost you per year? How many more deals could you do if you knew the underwriting secrets to getting funding from top-tier banks? Merrill always says, “You can’t win a game unless you know the rules.” Know what the lender guidelines are before you apply and optimize your fundability by getting your borrower profile and business profile in alignment with lending approval criteria.  Join Merrill every week here as he dives into funding secrets and shares his insights on things that are happening today, things that are part of the credit system, and things that can help you become more fundable.  He will also be featuring guest interviews with successful entrepreneurs who have mastered the Funding Game as well as business owners who are growing and optimizing their businesses using the principles of fundability.  Remember…You are just ONE approval away. It’s your turn to Get Fundable! because you certainly can be when you join us!",['en'],Merrill Chandler

I wanted to be able to advise individuals and families in building a stronger retirement, in order to be able to leave a legacy for their loved ones.”  Sixteen years ago, David Kilcrease entered the insurance and financial business, at the age of nineteen. He started with financial planning and debt consulting for both families and businesses. David then furthered his education at the University of Alabama, and earning a BS in Finance. Since that time, David has committed to continually expanding his education and knowledge base in order to meet his clients’ ever-changing needs and goals.  After his father died in 2009, David witnessed firsthand the challenges of facing the unexpected death of a loved one. He was struck by the financial hardship his mother experienced and the challenges she faced by what was left for her to live on. His parents did not have a plan in place, and perhaps their most crucial mistake was not hiring the right advisor to help them. As a result, they had failed to obtain the appropriate amount of coverage and lacked a cohesive plan to overcome the income loss which resulted from the death of his father.  Due to his own experience with his father’s death, it is David’s personal mission to educate his clients and to help ensure they have an effective financial plan in place.

Leaving behind careers to sell essential oils and fitness programs. Opting out of STEM to focus on their Paleo diet cookbook.And even when they stay in, they’re spending their lunch hours talking about their latest diet, getting up from their desks to do burpees or add a few more steps to their FitBit, waking up early or staying out late to beat their bodies into submission at hot yoga or Crossfit. They’re giving the money they earn to the women who have dropped out.We're making dangerous investments.We’re bought into the idea that health and fitness is where the money is, and if we could just spend or make a few more dollars and hit the next PR, all of our problems will be solved, we’ll improve our relationships, and finally stop hating our bodies. But though the Internet seems bullish on optimizing your health, no one ever talks about the real reason we’re feeling so bad in the skin we’re in: money.And it’s time that we had a conversation about it. In our increasingly branded and visual online world, we need to talk about how capital —both social and financial — affects the ways in which we hold onto damaging beliefs about our body image, fitness, and nutrition.And getting rewarded for disorder.The things we invest in often control us. This podcast isn't about eating disorders, though it does touch on how we're buying and selling disordered eating, fitness, and body image. But really, it's about the pervasiveness of brand, the difficulty of selling something authentically, and the sad fact that it's easier to sell something you can control (your body) than trying to control corporate America.This podcast will introduce you to marketing psychology and behavioral economics and tell the story of how we gave up our sense of embodiment, empowerment, and participation in the workforce in exchange for a few “likes” and the veneer of a “healthy” personal brand. The Your Body, Your Brand podcast brings experts in sales, marketing, branding, feminism, and coaching into conversation with coaches, entrepreneurs, and diet consumers to ask: Why do women keep dropping out of the workforce to sell diet/fitness/body image coaching?Why do people keep getting invested in following ""solopreneurs"" with fitness/diet/body image brands? Is becoming a brand based on your body ever a good thing?Visit the website to read show notes, meet the guests, and learn more about each episode: bodybrandpod.com.Support the podcast and receive exclusive extended audio interviews through our Patreon-only podcast feed: patreon.com/bodybrandpod.Reach Kaila Tova at yourbodyourbrand@gmail.comSupport this show http://supporter.acast.com/Your-Body-Your-Brand.

Based on the overwhelming lack of college recruiting education, and the numerous and costly mistakes being made by families The Realities of College Recruiting podcast was born. Each episode will interview top college coaches, player development experts, and recruiting insiders.   We will tackle the most critical college recruiting topics and will empower you with key insights, and critical recruiting strategies needed to gain a competitive advantage in your college recruiting process.   The SportsForce podcast is powered by our partner Five Tool Baseball.    About SportsForce Baseball:    SportsForce Baseball is a nationally recognized college recruiting advisory group with over 30 former college coaches, players, and MLB scouts in 11 different states. Our entire staff shares a strong passion for helping players and families find the best all-around college fit. View Our Team  During the last 11+ years, we’ve helped over 1,000 players make their college commitments, helping families save over $50 Million in college financial packages.   Unlike most recruiting companies, we DO NOT just partner with anyone.  Instead, we only partner with qualified student-athletes who meet our Five academic, athletic, and coachability selection factors.   Our staff personally evaluates well over 10,000 players each year at top tournaments, camps, and showcases. However we selectively advise, and advocate for only a few hundred players each year.  We carefully maintain a trusted nationwide network of hundreds of NCAA DI, DII, DIII, NAIA, and junior college coaches that we regularly communicate with in order to give our select group of players’ a competitive recruiting advantage to maximize potential offers.    We give our players and families a competitive edge in the recruiting process, help maximize their recruiting offers, and make the best all-around college decision.   We have numerous recruiting case studies and parent written success stories to prove it.

The foundation was a joint effort between college coaches and select clubs to establish events that provide quality competition at quality venues. The goal is to provide events that allow the players to showcase their abilities and do so in a manner that is friendly to the college recruiters and professional scouts while allowing the clubs to maintain fiscal responsibility to their members.  Our goal is to host local teams seeking exposure for their players while accommodating out of town clubs in a manner that minimizes travel and the expenses associated with select baseball. The mix of local and regional clubs provides great competition in a central location that is convenient for college recruiters and professional scouts in the central, Midwest, Northwest, Southeast, Texas, and West regions.

However, Meek did not let life get the best of her, 10 years later she resurfaces as a guest on The Daily Roundz Show. Meek’s guest appearance earned her a permit slot as co-host with Chuck Daily and Reggie Roundz.  Together the three of them not only built a humorous bond with the audience. They built a family bond with the group.  Meek B did not limit herself while working full-time in sales and managing being a mother and ironing out personal life issues. She dove deep into creating her own podcast, which was sponsored by Madd Bass Media Group, OFF THAT with Kas & Meek.  Meek B and Kasim Samad used their past pain and life lessons to help others understand they are not alone in this world and empowered the audience to self-heal, self educate and to let go of what no longer serves them.

Listen in as John interviews experts, dilettantes, sinners, and saints to explore their professional and personal perspective on the underlying purpose of the mysteries which lurk within the seemingly mundane nature of day-to-day life. John received his Master’s degree in clinical psychology and his Doctorate degree in Jungian psychology. He is in private practice and is also on the faculty of The Jung Center and The University of St. Thomas, both located in Houston, Texas. He lectures and teaches classes in subjects ranging from Parenting and Consciousness to Sex, Drugs and Rock & Roll. This podcast seeks to accept a challenge laid out by Carl Jung:  to explore the universal human feelings of emotional incompleteness, spiritual curiosity and one’s related search for wholeness and meaning. Interviews commence with the belief that, by engaging in this exploration, we can learn more about the psyche, consciousness, spirituality, philosophy and the profound, though often hidden, meaning of the day-to-day lives we lead (or which will lead us, if we aren’t watchful).Come along as John follows people into bars, universities, places of worship, financial districts and the home. He finds each context equally able to provide a setting for this worthy search and also that, through this process, we have an opportunity to come to know each other and ourselves much more deeply.",['en'],John Price

You are not alone as you struggle with being the perfect wife, mother, daughter, daughter-in-law, and all the other traditional roles assigned to us by our cultures. These pressures can feel overwhelming, and when we add the demands of a career on top of it all, many women choose to pass on dealing with money issues until they are forced to.  And that is not the best time to learn.Here we explore the stories of other women and how they have handled the demands of finances, family, and career. We talk about falling short of perfection, but also lessons learned and the best advice our peers have to offer for financial security and putting our perceived failures in their proper place.My mission is to take away the stigmas attached to women and money. To  make a difference in the lives of women by providing financial clarity and freedom. And it is my hope that the women listening will see that it is possible for them to take control of their financial destinies either by themselves or by having an outside partner they trust with their finances.Personal finance is NOT the exclusive domain of men, women were not born with any more or less ignorance about money. Finance is NOT a foreign language (it is quite basic, really). Armed with some basic knowledge about money, you gain independence and freedom of choice.  Freedom to leave a bad marriage, freedom to ask for a raise and not fear loss of a job, freedom to make choices after the death of a spouse and not be reliant on our children, confidence to retire with a plan that allows for us to have a life we love.The choice is yours.",['en'],Lynn S.

When you’re feeling out of balance, maybe even stuck, sometimes we don’t know what to do about it. Through our conversations we hope to help listeners achieve improved emotional and physical health, as well as greater internal validation, sense of connectedness, purpose, financial wellness, and spiritual awareness.   EmoZen conversations  encourage individuals to better connect to their soul in order to take conscious control of all aspects of the Self; therefore, improving well-being on a holistic scale. Individuals learn to be fully present and aware, utilizing all five senses, as well as their sixth sense (intuition) to better navigate through life and live with intention.    EmoZen works for all journeys, whether individuals seek deep healing from past traumas, or simply need coaching for better mind, body and life management. EmoZen conversations are intended to provide resources and skills for listeners to more fully manifest their dreams. It’s our hope to provide greater personal confidence during our conversations for more authentic connection to Self and others, providing more fulfilling relationships in all areas of life.",['en'],Krista Anderson

Find out more at https://blueprinthq.com.au/  About Sam Dean:  I’ve been an accountant for decades, with senior roles and a partnership in a large firm. I’ve also run my own (non-accounting) small business. That was a real eye-opener. I discovered just how little my profession understood the issues facing our small business clients, how little we listened and how much we could offer – if we only knew what to provide and how to do it.   That was when I realised it was time for an industry-wide mindset shift.  I’ve met so many people that provide professional services, with great skills and experience. But too many of us have lost confidence and our faith in our profession.   I get that because I’ve been there. I gained a lot of weight, drank far too much and lost sight of my dreams, my self-belief, my skills and my expertise. I looked for leadership, but I couldn’t find it.  Then one day, I woke up to hear a clear, strong voice in my head; It was time to make changes – BIG changes.  I embarked on a voyage of personal, business and financial discovery. I discovered and created systems to help people like us. Now I work with accounting and professional services businesses, helping them to create and grow financial advisory services that build great businesses for their clients and themselves.",['en-US'],Sam Dean

1245,3XPVCV6lLsPKfA1PzYannd,The Long Term Real Estate Investor Podcast hosted by Eduardo Sigal,"Hello, I'm Eduardo Sigal. Welcome to The Long term Real Estate Investor podcast, where you get the opportunity to learn from the experiences of family owned real estate companies and other professionals geared towards helping you make the right decisions for your investment goals.So you might ask yourself, why should I listen to this show? As in everything in life, decisions are what make our path to success or to failure. Unfortunately, there's a ton of information available that is in complete contradiction to what many successful investors actually do. This includes how to operate your investments when thinking about your personal financial needs and your family's future. On top of that, in today's world of instant returns, many crowdfunding platforms favor high return short length deals. This is usually at the cost of much bigger risk. The real estate crowdfunding market is growing fast. It's on its road to being a $300 billion industry and is bringing in more investors than ever before. This is due to big changes in regulatory restrictions. Here's the problem. There's not a ton of easily accessible quality and appropriate information available. I use the word appropriate because what works for institutions often times won't work for the individuals investment needs. This is because the goals and strategies are different. Let me give you some background. When I was young, I was fascinated with real estate. My father would bring me along with his partners for meetings. Some of them were big shots. I would listen to how they analyzed new opportunities and how they managed opportunities through different obstacles.As I got older and developed my skill sets in real estate, I would always unconsciously resort to those conversations for perspective. That's when I noticed the rarity of the wisdom I acquired from my unique circles. I couldn't find that kind of wisdom in any educational program I've been through, including my MBA program. Having the wisdom from landlords and industry leaders who have weathered these cycles is invaluable, as well as using that proven success and advice to design your long term real estate investment strategy. That is the solution. This podcast is personally exciting. Besides having a ton of respect for everyone, I bring on the podcast. I've been looking forward to these discussions because they shed light on how successful family owned real estate investment businesses approach investments and how you can too. I'll give you a clue. It's not always about the numbers, but it is about weathering the storm when things as they always do get rough. There's a unique wisdom to each conversation, and if you believe in learning from the success of others, then you will like this podcast and his community of like minded investors. You can add that to your portfolio. Want more solutions or to get in touch with us? Go to our website at WWW.LONGTERMREI.COM for articles, other podcasts, and more information.
